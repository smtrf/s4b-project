# Analysis of Gene Expression Differentiation Following Environmental Stressors

Next generation sequencing has provided opportunities to understand the molecular and genomic consequences of climate change induced environmental stressors on organisms. Specifically, RNA-seq has enabled us to understand what genes are being up- or down-regulated in response to these stressors. By analyzing gene expression data, we have a much greater understanding of the physiological consequences that have been previously described in many model species. 


## Project Objectives

In this project, I intend to develop scripts that will:
* Clean RNA-seq reads and align them to a reference genome (bash)
* Find differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (R)

These analyses will consist of RNA-seq data extracted from the common mouse species, *Mus musculus*, that was exposed to two separate treatment groups.
